## Challenge: timer games

+ Can you create a timer for a game or challenge? Think about whether you timers needs to count up or down, and about what colours it should have.

Use your timer to challenge a friend — one of you should watch the timer while the other completes the challenge.

Use one of these ideas as a challenge, or come up with your own:

+ Can you recite the alphabet in 5 seconds? What about backwards?

+ How many times can you type 'Code Club' in 10 seconds?

+ Gather together a number of classroom items, such as erasers and pencils. You get 20 seconds to try and memorize them all. Then you close your eyes while your partner removes an object. Can you identify the missing object in 10 seconds?
